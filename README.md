# Neuron-Companion

Simple python script, works on both CLI and through a little GUI window, to make generating samples for OCA's amazing

A1 EVO Neuron (almost) as easy as using the receiver's built-in Audyssey calibration!

## IMPORTANT NOTES

* This is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and will absolutely blow up your receiver, computer, reference mic, and any other equipment you let it near.  You have been warned, and I am not responsible.

* Your basic REW settings needs to be what OCA describes in [the Neuron video](https://youtu.be/mwmUpjwUgSk) - I will not provide REW support, or basic Python environment support.  If there is a problem with THIS SCRIPT, feel free to open an issue and I will try to look into it and address if possible, when and if I can.

REQUIRES A PRO UPGRADE FOR REW!

- It's not a lot of money relative to the high end gear we're calibrating here, and John does AMAZING work and provides insane amounts of free support!  Let's [support him back](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/upgrades.html) if we're able!

Must be run from the directory you have your Atmos sweep files in

* These can be downloaded a few places, I think A1 Evo Neuron comes with a set, but they're 256K I believe.  I use a 1M set I grabbed at some point along this journey.

Timeouts and WAV file expectations are set for 1M sweeps

* It will work with shorter sweeps, you'll just be waiting a bit longer for it to check if the sample is done
* You will have to update WAV_STIMULUS_FILENAME at the top of the script if you're using a different set

OCA deserves our support too!

* OCA also does INCREDIBLE work too, giving us INSANE value out of our already expensive hardware!  Don't forget you can send him a 'tip' from [any of his YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ocaudiophile/videos)!
