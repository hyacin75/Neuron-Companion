# Neuron-Companion

Simple python script, works on both CLI and through a little GUI window, to make generating samples for OCA's amazing

A1 EVO Neuron (almost) as easy as using the receiver's built-in Audyssey calibration!


## IMPORTANT NOTES

REQUIRES A PRO UPGRADE FOR REW!

- It's not a lot of money relative to the high end gear we're calibrating here, and John does AMAZING work and provides insane amounts of free support!  Let's support him back if we're able!

Must be run from the directory you have your Atmos sweep files in

* These can be downloaded a few places, I think A1 Evo Neuron comes with a set, but they're 256K I believe.  I use a 1M set I grabbed at some point along this journey.

Timeouts and WAV file expectations are set for 1M sweeps

* It will work with shorter sweeps, you'll just be waiting a bit longer for it to check if the sample is done
* You will have to update WAV_STIMULUS_FILENAME at the top of the script if you're using a different set

OCA deserves our support too!

* OCA also does INCREDIBLE work too, giving us INSANE value out of our already expensive hardware!  Don't forget you can send him a 'tip' from any of his YouTube videos!
